# XOXOday-Tweets-Analysis

This is a smaller scale project to showcase data handling and processing abilities.
I obtained the tweets collection by a business XOXOday which is a gifting solution providing company. Tweets span over 10 days in the End of January 2017. I have attached that Excel too along with the IPYNB which answers the Following Questions I attempted to find insight for:

### 1. Basic Tweet Statistics
Number of tweets
Number of unique users
Most active users (users who tweet the most)
Most used hashtags
Time-based trends (tweet frequency over time)

### 2. Sentiment Analysis

Classifying tweets as positive, neutral, or negative
